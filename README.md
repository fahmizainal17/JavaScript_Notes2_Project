A warm and heartfelt welcome to each and every one of you on this momentous occasionâ€”the 1st anniversary of the Malaysian Data Science Association, established on November 30, 2023. Today, we gather here not just as individuals but as a community bound by a shared passion for data science and a collective commitment to shaping the future through insights, innovation, and collaboration.

As we embark on this journey together, let us take a moment to reflect on the incredible strides we have made in the realm of data science over the past year. Our association, born out of a vision to bring together the brightest minds in the field, has grown into a vibrant and dynamic community that celebrates diversity, creativity, and the limitless possibilities that data science offers.

Our journey would not have been possible without the dedication and hard work of each member of this association. Your commitment to advancing the field of data science, fostering knowledge exchange, and promoting ethical practices is truly commendable. Together, we have created a space where ideas flourish, and where the pursuit of knowledge knows no bounds.

One of the hallmarks of our association is its commitment to open collaboration, and what better way to symbolize this than by hosting our community on GitHub. Today, we not only celebrate our anniversary but also mark the beginning of a new chapter as we launch our official GitHub repository. This platform will serve as a hub for sharing code, collaborating on projects, and nurturing the spirit of open-source innovation that is at the heart of data science.

As we move forward, let us continue to inspire and support one another. Let the collaborative spirit that defines our association guide us towards new discoveries, breakthroughs, and opportunities. Together, we have the power to transform the landscape of data science and contribute meaningfully to the world around us.

Once again, a warm welcome to our anniversary celebration. May the coming years be filled with even greater achievements, deeper connections, and boundless possibilities for the Malaysian Data Science Association.

Thank you, and let the celebration begin!")
